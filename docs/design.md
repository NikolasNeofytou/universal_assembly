# Design Overview

This document outlines the initial design goals for the Universal Assembly project.

1. **Hardware Detection**
   - Provide scripts to detect CPU features, memory configuration, and available peripherals.
2. **Core Instruction Set**
   - Define a minimal cross-platform set of instructions.
3. **Macro Library**
   - Offer building blocks and safety checks for assembly programmers.
4. **Tooling**
   - Develop an assembler that adapts to hardware scan results and warns about unsupported instructions.
