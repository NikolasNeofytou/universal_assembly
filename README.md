# Universal Assembly

The universal_assembly project aims to create a hardware-adaptive assembly language with a common core instruction set and extensible macros. This repository will contain hardware detection scripts, macro libraries, and documentation for building a universal assembler.

## Getting Started

- Run `python3 tools/hardware_scan.py` to display hardware information.
- See `docs/core_instruction_set.md` for the base instruction set.
- A basic assembler prototype is provided in `tools/assembler.py`.
